/*** mDNS Demo (instruction for usage)
 * The multicast Domain Name System (mDNS) resolves host names to IP addresses
 * within small networks that do not include a local name server.
 * More info on mDNS can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS
 * mDNS has two parts 1. Advertise 2. Listen
 * Bellow code (using ESP SDK) just does Advertise
 * Listen implementation is still on going work and will be basically porting
 * http://gkaindl.com/software/arduino-ethernet/bonjour to "Sming"
 *
 * In short this code will advertise other machines about its ipaddress.
 * But you can not convert other mDNS advertiser's host name to ipaddress. (this is work of Listening)
 *
 * How to use mDNS
 * 1. ADD your WIFI_SSID / Password
 * 2. Flash the Complied code to ESP8266
 * 3. According to OS of your PC / phone
 * 		A. Mac OS (iphone/ipad/ mac)
 * 			in Safari browser type "http://test.local/" to open a sample webpage.
 * 		B. Windows (You need Bonjour Service running. If you do not have it Install it from
 * 		   http://download.cnet.com/Bonjour-for-Windows/3000-18507_4-93550.html
 * 		   After installing in IE or Chrome or other browser type
 * 		   "http://test.local/" to open a sample webpage.
 * 		C. Linux  (You need to install Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon)
 * 			In your browser type "http://test.local/" to open a sample webpage.
 * 		D. Android
 * 			You need to install ZeroConf Browser or Bonjour Browser
 * 			In those app you would be able to see IP address of your ESP module
 * 			In android Chrome "http://test.local/" does not translate to IPaddres
 * 			So android Chrome is not supporting mDNS.
 * 			But you can make your own app using Network Service Discovery. Look at bellow link for details
